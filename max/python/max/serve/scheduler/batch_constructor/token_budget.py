    A ``TokenBudget`` tracks how many tokens have been consumed from a particular

    * Checking whether a :class:`TextGenerationContext` can be admitted to the
      batch via :meth:`status_after_context`.
    * Recording the token cost once a context has been accepted via
      :meth:`add_to_budget`.

    Implementations are free to interpret the token dimension they track, but
    they must respect the following contract:

    * If ``allow_chunking`` is True, implementations **may** call
      ``context.chunk`` to reduce the effective token cost against
      the budget.
    * :meth:`status_after_context` takes an optional ``num_steps`` argument
      describing how many generation steps the scheduler intends to run for the
      context. Budgets that care about future growth (for example, total-context
      limits) should incorporate this into their effective cost; others may
      ignore it and remain per-step.
    * :meth:`add_to_budget` is only called after a non-``BUDGET_EXHAUSTED``
      status and is responsible for incrementing :attr:`used` by the same
      effective token cost that was evaluated in :meth:`status_after_context`.
