GPU ran out of memory during model execution.

This typically happens when:
1. The model's runtime memory usage is too large for your GPU's memory
2. The batch size is too large for the available memory
3. The sequence length (max_length) is too large

Suggested solutions:
1. Reduce --device-memory-utilization to a smaller value
2. Reduce batch size with --max-batch-size parameter
3. Reduce sequence length with --max-length parameter
4. Reduce prefill chunk size with --prefill-chunk-size parameter
